pulseaudio (11.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Since this version, pulseaudio disables autospawn by default on linux
    systems, and replaces that with systemd socket activation. If you are not
    using systemd, then please edit or remove
    /etc/pulse/client.conf.d/00-disable-autospawn.conf
    to re-enable it.
